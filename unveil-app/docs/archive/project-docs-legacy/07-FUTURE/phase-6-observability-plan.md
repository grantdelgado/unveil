# Phase 6: Observability & Testing (Planning)

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: January 2025  
**Status**: üîÆ Future Planning  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1-5 Complete (v1.0.0)

---

## üéØ Objective

This phase will focus on expanding test coverage, implementing structured monitoring/logging dashboards, and integrating alerting for key system failures. Building on the unified logger system established in Phase 5, Phase 6 will add comprehensive observability and testing infrastructure.

---

## üìä Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ Foundation (Completed in Phase 5)
- **Unified Logger System**: Context-aware logging across all services
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error management patterns
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable codebase with consistent standards
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage in production code

### üîç Areas for Enhancement
- **Test Coverage**: Currently ~85%, targeting 95%+ comprehensive coverage
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: No centralized observability for production issues
- **Alerting System**: No automated alerts for critical system failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Limited production performance monitoring
- **Error Analytics**: No aggregated error trend analysis

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Implementation Areas

### 6.1 Test Coverage Expansion
**Priority**: üî¥ High
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

#### Unit Testing Enhancement
- **Target Files**: All service layer functions (lib/, services/)
- **Coverage Goal**: 95%+ for critical business logic
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for API endpoints

#### E2E Testing Infrastructure
- **Playwright Expansion**: Complete user journey coverage
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Safari, Mobile Safari validation
- **Performance Testing**: Core Web Vitals monitoring in CI/CD

#### Real-time Testing
- **Subscription Testing**: WebSocket connection reliability
- **Message Delivery**: End-to-end message flow validation
- **Media Upload**: File processing and delivery testing

### 6.2 Production Monitoring Dashboard
**Priority**: üü° Medium
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

#### Logging Aggregation
- **Service**: Integrate with logging service (Datadog, LogRocket, or Sentry)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain event_id and user_id context across all logs
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search across all application logs

#### Performance Metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS monitoring across all routes
- **API Response Times**: Database query performance tracking
- **Real-time Performance**: WebSocket connection stability metrics

#### Business Intelligence
- **Event Analytics**: Host dashboard usage, guest engagement metrics
- **Feature Adoption**: Message sending, media uploads, RSVP tracking
- **Error Impact**: User-facing error rates and recovery success

### 6.3 Alerting & Incident Response
**Priority**: üü° Medium
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

#### Critical System Alerts
- **Database Performance**: Query timeout and connection pool alerts
- **Authentication Failures**: High OTP failure rates or auth service downtime
- **File Storage**: Upload failures and storage quota alerts
- **Real-time Connectivity**: WebSocket disconnection rate thresholds

#### Business Impact Alerts
- **Host Experience**: Event creation failures, guest management issues
- **Guest Experience**: RSVP submission failures, media upload problems
- **Message Delivery**: SMS delivery failures, real-time message delays

### 6.4 Development Experience Enhancement
**Priority**: üü¢ Low
**Timeline**: 1 week

#### Enhanced Debugging Tools
- **Logger Dashboard**: Local development log aggregation and filtering
- **Database Query Inspector**: Real-time RLS policy validation
- **Real-time Connection Monitor**: WebSocket debugging interface

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Data Management**: Automated test user and event generation
- **Performance Budgets**: CI/CD integration for bundle size and performance
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Automated UI consistency validation
