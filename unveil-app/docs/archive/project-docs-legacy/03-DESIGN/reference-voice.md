# Unveil – Voice & Naming Guide

## 💬 Brand Voice Principles

### 1. Calm & Clear

Avoid clutter, confusion, or over-explanation. Say only what's needed—and say it gracefully.

✅ "You've joined Emma & Jordan's wedding weekend."
❌ "Welcome to the wedding celebration app for Emma and Jordan!"

---

### 2. Warm, Not Cliché

Romantic but grounded. Avoid wedding tropes unless reclaimed with subtle wit.

✅ "No memories yet—but they're coming."
❌ "Capture your special day forever with unforgettable photos!"

---

### 3. Friendly, Not Cute

Conversational, like a helpful friend. Skip the sass or tech/startup tone.

✅ "Broadcast sent. Guests will feel the love."
❌ "Boom! Message blasted 🚀"

---

### 4. Guide, Don't Command

Let the UX lead naturally—users should feel nudged, not bossed around.

✅ "Upload your favorite moment"
❌ "You must submit at least one photo to continue"

## ✍️ UX Copywriting Patterns

### ✅ Onboarding

- "You're invited to a weekend of celebration."
- "Let's get your info set up so you don't miss a moment."

### ✅ RSVP Flow

- "Will you be joining us?"
- "We'd love to know who's coming."

### ✅ Messaging

- "Broadcasts are one-way messages from the hosts."
- "Guests can reply privately."

### ✅ Media Upload

- "Share a moment from the day."
- "Emma & Jordan will see what you shared."

### ✅ Empty States

- "No messages yet—but they'll arrive soon."
- "This space will fill with photos, laughter, and love."

## 🙋 Last Rule: Human First

Always write like you're speaking directly to someone you care about. If it sounds robotic or transactional—rewrite it.
