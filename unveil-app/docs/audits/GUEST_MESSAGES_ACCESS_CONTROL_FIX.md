# Guest Messages Access Control Fix - Complete Solution

## Root Cause Identified

The user was seeing "Access denied: User is not a guest of this event" because they were **removed from the event** (`removed_at` timestamp set), but could still access the guest event page due to inconsistent access control logic.

## Issue Analysis

1. **Database State**: User has `removed_at: "2025-08-19 02:24:08.164988+00"` - they were removed from the event
2. **Access Control Gap**: `useEventWithGuest` hook was not filtering out removed guests
3. **RPC Security**: The messaging RPC correctly filtered out removed guests (as intended)
4. **User Experience**: User could access event page but not see messages, causing confusion

## Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Access Control Hook

**File:** `hooks/events/useEventWithGuest.ts`

- **Added**: `.is('removed_at', null)` filter to guest query
- **Result**: Removed guests can no longer access event pages

### 2. Enhanced RPC Error Messages

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250120000001_add_guest_event_messages_rpc.sql`

- **Added**: Separate check for removed guests with clearer error message
- **Result**: "Access denied: User has been removed from this event" instead of generic message

### 3. Improved Hook Error Handling

**File:** `hooks/messaging/useGuestMessagesRPC.ts`

- **Added**: User-friendly error message translation
- **Result**: "You are no longer a guest of this event" shown to users

### 4. Added Guest Event Page Protection

**File:** `app/guest/events/[eventId]/home/page.tsx`

- **Added**: Check for `!guestInfo` after loading completes
- **Result**: Removed guests see "No longer invited" message with clear explanation

## User Flow After Fix

### For Removed Guests:

1. **Access Event URL** → `useEventWithGuest` returns `guestInfo: null`
2. **Page Renders** → Shows "No longer invited" message
3. **Cannot Access Messages** → RPC blocks access with clear error
4. **Redirect Option** → "View Your Other Events" button

### For Active Guests:

1. **Access Event URL** → `useEventWithGuest` returns valid guest data
2. **Page Renders** → Full event access with all features
3. **Messages Load** → RPC returns messages successfully
4. **Realtime Updates** → Continue to work normally

## Security Guarantees Maintained

✅ **Event Access Control**: Removed guests cannot access event pages  
✅ **Message Security**: RPC enforces guest membership with removed check  
✅ **Consistent Logic**: All access points now use same removed guest filter  
✅ **Clear Messaging**: Users understand their access status

## Files Modified

1. `hooks/events/useEventWithGuest.ts` - Added removed guest filter
2. `supabase/migrations/20250120000001_add_guest_event_messages_rpc.sql` - Enhanced error messages
3. `hooks/messaging/useGuestMessagesRPC.ts` - User-friendly error translation
4. `app/guest/events/[eventId]/home/page.tsx` - Added removed guest UI handling

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Removed guest cannot access event page (shows "No longer invited")
- ✅ RPC provides clear error messages for debugging
- ✅ Active guests continue to have full access
- ✅ No breaking changes for existing functionality

## Resolution Summary

The original issue was **not a bug in the messaging system**, but rather **inconsistent access control** that allowed removed guests to access event pages while correctly blocking message access. This fix ensures:

1. **Consistent Security**: All access points respect the `removed_at` status
2. **Better UX**: Clear messaging about access status
3. **Proper Separation**: Page access and messaging access are now aligned
4. **Future-Proof**: Pattern can be applied to other guest-restricted features

The user will now see the "No longer invited" message instead of the confusing messaging error.
