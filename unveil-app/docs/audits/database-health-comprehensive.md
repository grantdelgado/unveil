# Database Health Comprehensive Guide

**Last Updated:** September 19, 2025  
**Status:** Active Reference  
**Scope:** Complete database health monitoring and maintenance

## Overview

This comprehensive guide consolidates all database health audits, checks, and maintenance procedures for the Unveil application. It serves as the canonical reference for database health monitoring, integrity checks, and visibility optimization.

## Quick Health Check

### Schema Health

- **Tables**: All critical tables present with proper constraints
- **Indexes**: Optimized for query patterns
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive coverage across all tables
- **Functions**: SECURITY DEFINER functions properly isolated

### Data Integrity

- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints enforced
- **Data Validation**: Check constraints and triggers active
- **Audit Trail**: Change tracking operational
- **Backup Status**: Regular backups configured

### Performance & Visibility

- **Query Performance**: Index usage optimized
- **Connection Health**: Pool management active
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics available
- **Alerting**: Performance thresholds configured

## Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Checks

1. Connection pool health
2. Query performance metrics
3. Error rate monitoring
4. Backup verification

### Weekly Checks

1. Index usage analysis
2. Table size monitoring
3. RLS policy verification
4. Function performance review

### Monthly Checks

1. Schema drift detection
2. Data integrity audits
3. Performance optimization review
4. Security policy updates

## Appendix â€” Historical Notes (merged 2025-09-19)

*The following sections contain historical audit data that has been consolidated into this comprehensive guide.*

### Database Schema Audit (2025-01-31)

**Original Report:** `docs/audits/db-health/2025-01-31-schema.md`

Schema audit of core messaging tables (`messages`, `message_deliveries`, `event_guests`, `scheduled_messages`) shows a well-structured system with comprehensive RLS policies and appropriate indexing. No critical schema drift detected.

#### Key Findings

- **Tables Structure**: 4 core tables with proper UUID PKs and enum types
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive security policies across all tables
- **Indexes**: 45+ indexes optimized for query patterns
- **Functions**: 42+ SECURITY DEFINER functions with mixed search_path configurations

#### Recommendations Implemented

- Standardized search path for SECURITY DEFINER functions
- Added comprehensive index monitoring
- Documented security model for functions

**Schema Health Score: 9/10** - Excellent design with minor improvements in function hardening consistency.
