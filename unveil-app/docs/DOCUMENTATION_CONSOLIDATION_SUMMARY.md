# Documentation Consolidation Summary

**Date Completed:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Initiative:** Context Hygiene - Establish Single Canonical Source of Truth

---

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Established a single, canonical source of truth for Unveil&apos;s engineering context, eliminating conflicting documentation and improving AI tool (Cursor, MCP) effectiveness.

---

## ✅ Completed Actions

### 1. Created Canonical Context Document
**Location:** `/docs/context/unveil-product-eng-context.md`

**Contents:**
- Complete system architecture overview
- Database schema quick reference with key tables and relationships
- RLS security patterns and policy examples
- Frontend architecture (directory structure, component patterns, hooks)
- Real-time feature implementation
- Common development workflows
- Troubleshooting guide (common pitfalls & solutions)
- Code style & standards
- Testing guidelines
- Deployment checklist
- Links to all specialized documentation

**Size:** 21KB comprehensive reference document

### 2. Archived Historical Documentation
Created structured archive at `/docs/_archive/` with four categories:

#### **reports_2024-2025/** (65 files archived)
- Performance and bundle analysis reports
- Database audit and optimization reports
- Documentation consolidation reports
- Test stability and code quality reports
- Messaging system audits
- Platform health assessments
- All dated September 2024 through September 2025

#### **rls_historical/** (3 files archived)
- Historical RLS optimization reports
- RLS consolidation documentation
- RLS audit reports from 2024-2025

#### **database_fixes_2024-2025/** (1 file archived)
- Completed database fix: `event-creation-schema-fix.md`
- Documents RSVP-Lite migration `rsvp_status` column removal

#### **audits_2024-2025/** (Directory created for future use)

Each archive directory includes a `README.md` with:
- Archive purpose and context
- When to reference archived files
- When NOT to reference (pointing to canonical docs)
- Links to current documentation

### 3. Updated Documentation Hub
**Location:** `/docs/README.md`

**Changes:**

**Location:** `/README.md`

**Changes:**
- Added "Start Here (Canonical Reference)" section
- Highlighted Engineering Context as "SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH"
- Updated documentation table to include canonical context as first entry
- Added link to historical archives

### 5. Created Audit Documentation
**Location:** `/docs/_AUDIT_PLAN_DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION.md`

Comprehensive 300+ line audit plan documenting:
- Current state inventory
- Files identified for archival
- Proposed canonical structure
- Archive plan with file counts
- Safety checks and rollback strategy
- Acceptance criteria
