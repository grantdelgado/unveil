**Date:** February 1, 2025  
**Implementation:** Week 1 Critical Performance Optimizations  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## 🎯 Week 1 Objectives & Results

This report summarizes the implementation of Week 1 performance optimizations from the [PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md](./PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md), focusing on the highest impact, lowest effort improvements.

---

## ✅ Completed Optimizations

### 1. Font Loading Optimization (🔴 High Priority)

**Target:** 200-300ms FCP improvement

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Replaced `next/font/google` with `next/font/local`
- ✅ Downloaded Inter Variable font files (woff2 format)
- ✅ Added `display: 'swap'` and `preload: true` for optimal loading
- ✅ Removed Google Fonts DNS prefetch links

**Code Changes:**

```tsx
// Before: app/layout.tsx
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
const inter = Inter({
  variable: '--font-inter',
  subsets: ['latin'],
});

// After: app/layout.tsx
import localFont from 'next/font/local';
const inter = localFont({
  src: [
    {
      path: '../public/fonts/inter-variable.woff2',
      style: 'normal',
    },
    {
      path: '../public/fonts/inter-variable-italic.woff2',
      style: 'italic',
    },
  ],
  variable: '--font-inter',
  display: 'swap',
  preload: true,
});
```

**Expected Impact:** ✅ Eliminates font loading render blocking (~200-300ms FCP improvement)

---

### 2. React Query Configuration (🔴 High Priority)

**Target:** 50% reduction in unnecessary API calls

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Disabled `refetchOnWindowFocus` to prevent aggressive background requests
- ✅ Maintained `refetchOnReconnect: 'always'` for data consistency

**Code Changes:**

```tsx
// Before: lib/react-query-client.tsx
refetchOnWindowFocus: true,  // Too aggressive for wedding app

// After: lib/react-query-client.tsx
refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // Reduce unnecessary API calls
```

**Expected Impact:** ✅ Significantly reduced background API requests, especially on mobile

---

### 3. Event Sorting Memoization (🟡 Medium Priority)

**Target:** Reduced re-renders on /select-event page

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Added `useMemo` import to useUserEvents hook
- ✅ Extracted sorting logic into memoized computation
- ✅ Separated raw events state from computed sorted events
- ✅ Proper dependency array with only `[rawEvents]`

**Code Changes:**

```tsx
// Before: hooks/events/useUserEvents.ts
const [events, setEvents] = useState<UserEvent[]>([]);
// Sorting happened inside fetchUserEvents on every call

// After: hooks/events/useUserEvents.ts
const [rawEvents, setRawEvents] = useState<GetUserEventsReturn[]>([]);

// Memoized sorting logic to prevent unnecessary re-computations
const events = useMemo(() => {
  const sortedEvents = (rawEvents || [])
    .sort((a, b) => {
      // Host events first, then by date
      // ... sorting logic
    })
    .map((event) => ({
      /* transformation */
    }));
  return sortedEvents;
}, [rawEvents]);
```

**Expected Impact:** ✅ Eliminates unnecessary sorting computations on re-renders

## 🚀 Week 2 Implementation Results

**Date:** February 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### ✅ Week 2 Completed Optimizations

#### 1. Selective Analytics Loading (🔴 High Priority)

**Target:** ~40% faster initial page load

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Modified `app/select-event/page.tsx` to defer analytics loading
- ✅ Added `expandedEventId` state to track which event needs analytics
- ✅ Implemented hover-triggered analytics loading for better UX
- ✅ Added loading indicators for analytics fetch state
- ✅ Removed aggressive analytics pre-loading for all events

**Code Changes:**

```tsx
// Before: Load ALL event analytics on page load
useEffect(() => {
  if (events && events.length > 0) {
    const eventIds = events.map(e => e.event_id);
    fetchAnalytics(eventIds); // Loads analytics for ALL events
  }
}, [events, fetchAnalytics]);

// After: Selective loading with hover interaction
const [expandedEventId, setExpandedEventId] = useState<string | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (expandedEventId) {
    fetchAnalytics([expandedEventId]); // Only load for expanded event
  }
}, [expandedEventId, fetchAnalytics]);

// Trigger on hover for better UX
onMouseEnter={() => {
  if (!isExpanded && !eventInsights) {
    setExpandedEventId(event.event_id);
  }
}}
```

**Expected Impact:** ✅ 40% faster select-event page load (reduced API calls from N to 1)

---

#### 2. Bundle Dependencies Optimization (🔴 High Priority)

**Target:** Reduce client-side bundle bloat

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Moved `twilio` to devDependencies (server-only package)
- ✅ Moved `@sentry/tracing` to devDependencies (redundant with @sentry/nextjs)
- ✅ Optimized Sentry configuration for minimal bundle impact
- ✅ Reduced trace sampling in production (0.1 instead of 1.0)
- ✅ Removed unnecessary Sentry integrations

**Code Changes:**

```json
// package.json - Moved server-only deps
"devDependencies": {
  "@sentry/tracing": "^7.120.3",  // Moved from dependencies
  "twilio": "^5.7.0",            // Moved from dependencies
}
```

```tsx
// sentry.edge.config.ts - Optimized configuration
Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 0.1 : 1.0,
  debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  integrations: [], // Minimal integrations for smaller bundle
});
```

**Expected Impact:** ✅ Reduced client bundle size by removing server-only packages

---

#### 3. Centralized Query Invalidation Strategy (🟡 Medium Priority)

**Target:** Consistent cache management and fresher data

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Created `lib/queryUtils.ts` with centralized invalidation logic
- ✅ Implemented smart invalidation based on mutation type
- ✅ Applied to RSVP mutations (`useUpdateGuestRSVP`, `useBulkUpdateGuestRSVP`)
- ✅ Applied to messaging mutations (`useSendMessage`)
- ✅ Applied to guest event mutations (`useEventWithGuest`)
- ✅ Replaced scattered invalidation patterns with consistent approach

**Code Changes:**

```tsx
// lib/queryUtils.ts - Centralized invalidation utilities
export async function smartInvalidation({
  queryClient,
  mutationType,
  eventId,
  userId,
}: InvalidationOptions & {
  mutationType: 'rsvp' | 'guest' | 'message' | 'event' | 'media';
}) {
  switch (mutationType) {
    case 'rsvp':
      await invalidateGuestQueries({ queryClient, eventId });
      break;
    // ... other cases
  }
}

// Before: Scattered manual invalidation
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: guestQueryKeys.eventGuests(eventId),
});

// After: Centralized smart invalidation
await smartInvalidation({
  queryClient,
  mutationType: 'rsvp',
  eventId,
});
```

**Expected Impact:** ✅ More consistent data freshness and simplified maintenance
