# Rollups Revert Summary

## What Was Removed

**Database Objects:**
- `message_delivery_rollups_v1` view - Computed rollup analytics per message
- `get_message_rollups(uuid)` RPC function - Event-scoped rollup access
- `final_status` generated column in `message_deliveries` - Unified delivery status
- `idx_md_message_final` and `idx_md_message_final_updated` indexes - Performance optimizations

**Application Code:**
- `hooks/messaging/useMessageRollups.ts` - Complete rollup hook file
- Rollup integration in `RecentMessages.tsx` - Reverted to use original message data
- Migration `20250130000030_message_rollups_view.sql` - Original rollup implementation

## What Was Kept

**Database Columns:**
- `messages.delivered_count` - Used by RecentMessages component
- `messages.failed_count` - Used by RecentMessages component  
- `messages.delivered_at` - Used by RecentMessages component

**Reason:** Active UI dependencies prevent safe removal of these columns.

## Why Reverted

The rollup system was removed because:
1. **No delivery confirmation available** - Most messages show `sms_status = 'sent'` (not 'delivered'), making rollup counts consistently zero
2. **Counters unused at source** - The original `delivered_count`/`failed_count` columns contain default values and aren't populated by webhooks
3. **Complexity without benefit** - The view-based approach added infrastructure overhead without providing actionable data

## Messaging/Twilio Unchanged

✅ **No changes to send pipeline** - Message sending, Twilio webhooks, and delivery tracking remain untouched  
✅ **No RLS modifications** - Row Level Security policies preserved  
✅ **No functional regressions** - Guest/host messaging behavior identical to pre-rollup state

## Verification Completed

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint passes with no warnings  
- ✅ Next.js build completes successfully
- ✅ Database objects confirmed removed
- ✅ UI reverted to original message data source

The system is now in a clean state with rollup infrastructure removed while preserving all existing messaging functionality.
