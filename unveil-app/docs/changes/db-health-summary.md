# Database Health Audit Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-31  
**Audit Type:** Read-Only End-to-End Database Health Check  
**Scope:** Messaging & Core Tables (messages, message_deliveries, event_guests, scheduled_messages)

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Overall Health Score: 9.0/10** - Excellent database health with zero critical issues. The messaging system shows robust data integrity, proper security controls, and healthy operational patterns. Minor improvements needed in function security hardening consistency.

## üìä Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths Identified
- **Perfect Data Integrity**: Zero orphaned records, consistent status values
- **Robust Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies with proper event scoping  
- **Optimal Performance**: Well-designed indexes for all query patterns
- **Healthy Operations**: No stuck automations or processing backlogs
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper enum usage, FK constraints, and nullable design

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **Inconsistent Function Hardening**: Mixed search_path patterns in SECURITY DEFINER functions
- **Limited RPC Testing**: Visibility audit couldn't directly test guest access functions
- **Missing Automation Triggers**: No triggers found in audit scope (needs investigation)

## üö® Top 5 Actionable Items

### CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)
**None identified** - No critical security or data integrity issues found.

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix This Sprint)

#### 1. Standardize SECURITY DEFINER Function Hardening
**Issue:** Inconsistent `search_path` configurations across functions  
**Risk:** Potential privilege escalation via search_path manipulation  
**Fix:** Audit all SECURITY DEFINER functions and standardize to `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`  
**Owner:** [TODO]  
**ETA:** [TODO]  

#### 2. Investigate Missing Triggers
**Issue:** No triggers found in messaging table scope  
**Risk:** Potential automation gaps in updated_at maintenance or delivery processing  
**Fix:** Verify if triggers exist elsewhere or if application-level automation is sufficient  
**Owner:** [TODO]  
**ETA:** [TODO]  

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix Next Sprint)

#### 3. Implement RPC Function Testing
**Issue:** Guest message access functions not directly tested in audit  
**Risk:** Potential visibility bugs not caught by schema-only analysis  
**Fix:** Create integration tests for `get_guest_event_messages_v2()` and related functions  
**Owner:** [TODO]  
**ETA:** [TODO]  

#### 4. Set Up Automated Health Monitoring  
**Issue:** Manual audit process doesn't catch regressions  
**Risk:** Data integrity issues could develop between audits  
**Fix:** Implement automated checks for orphans, counter drift, and past-due messages  
**Owner:** [TODO]  
**ETA:** [TODO]  

### LOW PRIORITY (Future Improvements)

#### 5. Clean Up Legacy Counter Fields
**Issue:** `delivered_count`/`failed_count` marked as "legacy" but still maintained  
**Risk:** Unnecessary complexity and potential confusion  
**Fix:** Evaluate if these fields can be safely removed or if they serve UI compatibility  
**Owner:** [TODO]  
**ETA:** [TODO]  

## ‚úÖ Safe to Ignore

### Schema Design Choices
- **No `updated_at` on messages table**: By design - messages are immutable
- **Complex RLS policies**: Necessary for proper multi-tenant security
- **Multiple indexes per table**: Required for diverse query patterns
- **Nullable FK columns**: Supports guest invitation workflow before user creation

### Operational Patterns  
- **Zero delivery counters**: Expected if using 'sent' vs 'delivered' status tracking
- **Mixed message types**: Normal for announcement vs direct message workflows
- **Event guest lifecycle complexity**: Required for invitation/RSVP/decline workflows

## üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails to Prevent Recurrence

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All new SECURITY DEFINER functions include `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- [ ] New message-related queries use proper event scoping via RLS policies
- [ ] FK constraints added for all new relationship columns
- [ ] Indexes added for new query patterns (especially event_id + timestamp combinations)

### Automated Checks (Recommended CI/CD Integration)
```sql
-- Check for SECURITY DEFINER functions without proper search_path
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc p 
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = p.pronamespace 
WHERE n.nspname = 'public' AND p.prosecdef 
AND pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) NOT LIKE '%SET search_path%';

-- Check for orphaned message deliveries  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM message_deliveries md 
LEFT JOIN messages m ON m.id = md.message_id 
WHERE m.id IS NULL;

-- Check for past-due scheduled messages
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scheduled_messages 
WHERE send_at < now() AND status NOT IN ('sent','cancelled');
```

### Development Standards
1. **Function Security**: Always use `SECURITY DEFINER` with explicit `search_path`
2. **Query Patterns**: Always scope by `event_id` in messaging queries
3. **Status Management**: Use enum constraints for all status fields
4. **Timestamp Hygiene**: Ensure `updated_at` triggers exist for mutable tables

## üìà Success Metrics

### Immediate (Post-Fix)
- [ ] 100% of SECURITY DEFINER functions have standardized `search_path`
- [ ] Trigger investigation completed with documented findings
- [ ] Zero critical security findings in follow-up audit

### Ongoing (Monthly Monitoring)
- [ ] Zero orphaned message_deliveries records
- [ ] Zero past-due scheduled_messages  
- [ ] <1% counter drift between persisted and computed values
- [ ] 100% RLS policy coverage for new tables

### Long-term (Quarterly Review)
- [ ] Automated health checks integrated into CI/CD
- [ ] Performance regression testing for messaging queries
- [ ] Security audit of new SECURITY DEFINER functions

### Generated Reports
- `docs/audits/db-health/2025-01-31-schema.md` - Complete schema analysis
- `docs/audits/db-health/2025-01-31-integrity.md` - Data integrity findings  
- `docs/audits/db-health/2025-01-31-visibility.md` - Message visibility analysis
