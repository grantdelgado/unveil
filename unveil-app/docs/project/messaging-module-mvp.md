# Host Messaging Module MVP - Enhanced Segmentation System

**📅 Timeline**: 2-3 weeks development  
**🎯 Goal**: Enhanced host-side messaging with advanced recipient filtering and preview capabilities  
**📊 Status**: Phase 5 Complete - Analytics & Insights Platform ✅  
**🏗️ Architecture**: Container-Hook-View pattern with Supabase MCP integration

---

## 📘 Overview

The enhanced messaging system MVP builds upon the existing messaging infrastructure to provide hosts with sophisticated guest segmentation and recipient preview capabilities. This system will enable hosts to send targeted announcements and reminders to carefully filtered guest segments while maintaining the app&apos;s privacy-conscious and mobile-first design principles.

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Existing Features:**
- Message Composer with basic recipient filtering (`all` vs `pending_rsvp`)
- Message History view with chronological message display
- Rich text formatting with markdown support
- Character count (1000 limit) and validation
- Integration with Supabase `messages` table
- Scheduled messaging UI (MVP placeholder)

**Database Schema:**
- `messages` table: stores message content, type, and sender
- `event_guests` table: contains `guest_tags[]`, `rsvp_status`, `phone`, `guest_name`
- `scheduled_messages` table: full featured for advanced scheduling
- Helper functions: `resolve_message_recipients()`, `guest_has_any_tags()`, `guest_has_all_tags()`

**Current Limitations:**
- Only 2 filter options (all guests vs pending RSVPs)
- No tag-based filtering in UI
- No recipient preview before sending
- Limited recipient segmentation capabilities

---

## 🛠 Proposed Features

### 1. **Enhanced Recipient Selector**
Replace the current basic dropdown with a sophisticated multi-criteria filtering system:

**Filter Categories:**
- **RSVP Status**: All, Attending, Pending, Maybe, Declined
- **Guest Tags**: Multi-select from available tags (e.g., "Family", "College Friends", "Work Colleagues")
- **Combination Logic**: AND/OR operations between different filter types

**UI Implementation:**
- Tabbed or accordion interface for different filter types
- Tag selection with emoji indicators (🎓 College Friends, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family, 💼 Work)
- Real-time recipient count updates as filters change
- Clear filter state management

### 2. **Recipient Preview Panel**
A dynamic preview that updates automatically based on selected filters:

**Display Elements:**
- Scrollable list of matching guests (max height with scroll)
- Guest display format: `Full Name` + tag emoji indicators
- Total count prominently displayed: "Sending to X guests"
- Empty state handling with helpful messaging

**Privacy & Performance:**
- Only show guest names and tag indicators (no contact info)
- Virtualized list for events with large guest counts
- Debounced filter updates to prevent excessive re-renders

### 3. **Enhanced Message Composition**
Building on existing rich text capabilities:

**Message Types:**
- 📢 **Announcement**: General updates, event details
- 📧 **RSVP Reminder**: Auto-suggests pending RSVP filter
- 🎉 **Thank You**: Post-event appreciation messages

**Smart Defaults:**
- RSVP Reminder automatically filters to pending guests
- Template suggestions based on message type
- Character count with SMS-friendly guidelines

### 4. **Intelligent Send Flow**
Streamlined sending process with confirmations:

**Confirmation Modal:**
- Recipient summary: "X guests will receive this message"
- Message preview with truncation if needed
- Send channel selection (Push notification as default)
- Estimated delivery time

**Error Handling:**
- Guests without phone numbers automatically excluded with warning
- Network failure retry mechanisms
- Clear error messages for common issues

### 5. **Schedule for Later (MVP Foundation)**
Lay groundwork for post-MVP scheduling features:

**Current Implementation:**
- Disabled UI checkbox with "Post-MVP Feature" label
- Date/time picker interface (non-functional)
- Database schema already supports scheduling via `scheduled_messages`

**Future Expansion Ready:**
- Clean integration points for scheduling service
- Compatible with existing `scheduled_messages` table structure

---

## 🧪 Testing & Edge Cases

### Guest Segmentation Scenarios
- **Empty Segments**: Gracefully handle filters that return no guests
- **Overlapping Tags**: Ensure OR logic works correctly with multiple tags
- **Missing Data**: Handle guests with null/empty tag arrays
- **Large Guest Lists**: Performance testing with 500+ guests

### Message Delivery Edge Cases
- **Invalid Phone Numbers**: Skip guests with malformed phone data
- **Opt-out Handling**: Respect `sms_opt_out` flags in guest records
- **Duplicate Recipients**: Ensure no guest receives multiple copies
- **Network Failures**: Retry logic and user feedback

### UI/UX Edge Cases
- **No Tags Available**: Handle events where no guests have tags yet
- **Single Guest Events**: Ensure UI scales down appropriately
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on various screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility

---

## 🧱 Database Queries & Supabase Integration

### Guest Filtering Queries
Using existing Supabase functions for optimal performance:

```sql
-- Get guests by RSVP status and tags
SELECT * FROM resolve_message_recipients(
  msg_event_id := $1,
  target_tags := $2,
  require_all_tags := $3,
  target_rsvp_statuses := $4
);

-- Tag statistics for filter UI
SELECT 
  unnest(guest_tags) as tag,
  COUNT(*) as guest_count
FROM event_guests 
WHERE event_id = $1 
  AND guest_tags IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tag
ORDER BY guest_count DESC;
```

### Message Creation
Leverage existing `sendMessageToEvent` service with enhanced filter support:

```typescript
// Enhanced recipient filter interface
interface RecipientFilter {
  type: 'all' | 'tags' | 'rsvp_status' | 'combined';
  tags?: string[];
  rsvpStatuses?: string[];
  requireAllTags?: boolean;
}

// Example usage
await sendMessageToEvent({
  eventId,
  content: message,
  recipientFilter: {
    type: 'combined',
    tags: ['Family', 'College Friends'],
    rsvpStatuses: ['pending'],
    requireAllTags: false
  },
  messageType: 'announcement',
  sendVia: { sms: false, email: false, push: true }
});
```

### Real-time Updates
Utilize existing real-time subscription infrastructure:

```typescript
// Subscribe to guest updates for live recipient counts
const { data, error } = supabase
  .from('event_guests')
  .select('id, guest_tags, rsvp_status, guest_name')
  .eq('event_id', eventId)
  .on('UPDATE', (payload) => {
    // Update recipient counts in real-time
    updateRecipientPreview(payload);
  })
  .subscribe();
```
