# Host Composer — Explicit Type Selector Implementation

**Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**  
**Result:** Host composer now has explicit message type selector with server validation

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the explicit message type selector for host composing with clear separation between **Audience** (who sees in app) and **Notified now (SMS)** counts. All message types are server-validated and persist correctly to the database.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Message Type Selector ✅

- **Sticky pills at top:** `📢 Announcement · 🏷️ Channel · 💬 Direct`
- **Session storage:** Remembers last selected type per session
- **Mobile-optimized:** ≥44px touch targets, safe-area padding
- **Default:** Announcement on first load

### 2. Type-Specific Audience Controls ✅

**Announcement:**

- **Audience:** "Everyone in this event" (read-only)
- **Copy:** "Visible in app to all current and future guests"
- **SMS Count:** Shows current guest count
- **Footnote:** "No retro texts will be sent later"

**Channel:**

- **Audience:** Tag selector (vip, family, friends, vendors)
- **Copy:** "Visible in app to anyone with these tags (past & future)"
- **SMS Count:** "Currently notified via SMS: {count} guests with these tags"
- **Validation:** Requires ≥1 tag to enable sending

**Direct:**

- **Audience:** Person checklist (unchanged)
- **Copy:** "Visible only to the selected recipients"
- **Large audience tip:** Suggests Announcement/Channel for >50 recipients
- **Validation:** Requires ≥1 selected person

### 3. Server-Side Validation ✅

**Validation Rules Applied:**

- `announcement` + subset of guests → coerce to `direct`
- `channel` + no tags → coerce to `direct`
- `direct` + all guests → coerce to `announcement`

**Database Truth:** Server-validated `message_type` persisted to `messages` table
**API Response:** Returns `finalMessageType` for confirmation modal

### 4. Enhanced Confirmation Modal ✅

**Type-Specific Copy:**

- **Announcement:** "Visible in app to all current and future guests. SMS sent now to {count}."
- **Channel:** "Visible in app to anyone with selected tags. SMS sent now to {count} tag members."
- **Direct:** "Only the selected recipients can see this. SMS sent now to {count}."

**Visual Indicators:**

- Type-specific emojis (📢 🏷️ 💬)
- Clear "Notified now (SMS)" vs "Audience" separation

### 5. Mobile UX Polish ✅

- **Safe area padding:** `paddingBottom: calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
- **Touch targets:** All buttons ≥44px with `touch-manipulation`
- **Viewport height:** `min-h-[100svh]` for proper mobile display
- **Sticky positioning:** Type selector and send bar remain accessible

## 🔄 Complete Flow

### 1. Host Composer Experience

```
1. Select message type (Announcement · Channel · Direct)
2. Type-specific audience controls appear
3. Compose message content
4. Send button shows "Send Now · {count} [guests|tag members|people]"
5. Confirmation modal displays server-validated type and SMS count
```

### 2. Server Processing

```
1. Receive messageType from client
2. Apply validation/coercion rules
3. Create message with finalMessageType
4. Create delivery records (unchanged)
5. Send SMS via Twilio (unchanged)
6. Return finalMessageType in response
```

### 3. Guest Experience (V2 Read Model)

```
1. Direct messages: Visible only via deliveries (privacy)
2. Announcements: Visible to all guests (including late joiners)
3. Channels: Visible to guests with matching tags (dynamic)
4. Catchup indicators: "Posted before you joined" for historical messages
```

## 📊 Validation Results

### Database Testing ✅

- **Announcement type:** ✅ Successfully inserted and retrieved
- **Channel type:** ✅ Successfully inserted and retrieved
- **Direct type:** ✅ Successfully inserted and retrieved
- **Enum validation:** ✅ All types accepted by `message_type_enum`

### SMS Pipeline Verification ✅

- **Delivery creation:** Unchanged - all types create delivery records
- **Twilio integration:** Unchanged - SMS triggered by delivery records
- **No retro sends:** Historical message visibility doesn't trigger SMS

### UX Validation ✅

- **Type selector:** Sticky, accessible, session-persistent
- **Audience controls:** Switch correctly based on selected type
- **Send button:** Shows accurate count with type-specific labels
- **Confirmation modal:** Displays server-validated type and SMS counts

## 🎉 Key Benefits

### 1. Clear Mental Model

- **Audience vs Notifications:** Host understands who sees in app vs who gets SMS now
- **Type-Specific Controls:** UI adapts to show relevant options only
- **Server Authority:** Database truth prevents client/server type mismatches

### 2. Enhanced Flexibility

- **Channel Messaging:** Tag-based targeting with dynamic visibility
- **Announcement Clarity:** Event-wide messaging with future-joiner visibility
- **Direct Privacy:** Person-specific messaging remains delivery-gated

### 3. Improved UX

- **Session Persistence:** Remembers preferred message type
- **Mobile Optimization:** Touch-friendly controls with safe area support
- **Validation Feedback:** Clear requirements for each message type
