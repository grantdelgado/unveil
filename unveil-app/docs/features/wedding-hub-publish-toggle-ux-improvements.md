# Wedding Hub "Publish" Toggle - UX Improvements

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Related:** [Investigation Report](./wedding-hub-publish-toggle-investigation.md)

---

## Summary

Improved the UX clarity of the "Publish your wedding hub now?" toggle to reduce guest confusion. All changes are purely cosmetic—no underlying logic, RLS policies, or database behavior was modified.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Renamed Toggle Label (Both Create & Edit Flows)

**Before:**
```
Publish your wedding hub now?
```

**After:**
```
Make your wedding hub visible to invited guests?
```

**Files Changed:**
- `components/features/events/EventBasicsStep.tsx` (Create flow)
- `components/features/host-dashboard/EventDetailsEditor.tsx` (Edit flow)

**Reasoning:** The word "publish" implies permanence. The new label emphasizes reversibility and clarifies that this controls visibility to **invited guests** specifically.

---

### 2. ✅ Updated Microcopy (Both Create & Edit Flows)

**Before:**
```
Guests will be able to see your wedding hub as soon as they log in
with their invited phone number. You can also choose to add guests
before publishing.
```

**After:**
```
When enabled, invited guests will see this event after logging in. 
If disabled, you can still invite them now—but they won't see 
anything until you publish.
```

**Files Changed:**
- `components/features/events/EventBasicsStep.tsx`
- `components/features/host-dashboard/EventDetailsEditor.tsx`

**Reasoning:** The new copy explicitly addresses the confusing edge case: hosts can send invitations to unpublished events, but guests won't see anything.

---

### 3. ✅ Added Warning in Bulk Invitation Flow

**When Shown:**
- Event has `is_public = false` (unpublished)
- Host is about to send bulk invitations
- At least one guest is eligible

**Warning Message:**
```
⚠️ Event is hidden from guests

Invited guests won't be able to see this event until you make it visible. 
You can update visibility in Event Settings.
```

**Files Changed:**
- `components/features/host-dashboard/ConfirmBulkInviteModal.tsx` (Added `isEventPublic` prop and warning UI)
- `components/features/host-dashboard/GuestManagement.tsx` (Passed `isEventPublic` prop)
- `components/features/host-dashboard/types.ts` (Added `isEventPublic` to interface)
- `app/host/events/[eventId]/guests/page.tsx` (Passed `event?.is_public` from page data)

**Reasoning:** This prevents the confusing scenario where hosts send invitations but guests can't access the event.

---

### 4. ✅ Added "Hidden from guests" Badge (Host Dashboard)

**Where Shown:**
- Event dashboard summary card (`EventSummaryCard`)
- Only displayed when `event.is_public = false`

**Badge Design:**
```tsx
🔒 Hidden from guests
```
- Amber background (`bg-amber-50`)
- Amber border (`border-amber-200`)
- Positioned next to event title

**Files Changed:**
- `components/features/host-dashboard/EventSummaryCard.tsx`

**Reasoning:** Provides at-a-glance visibility status on the main dashboard. Hosts can immediately see if their event is hidden.

## Visual Examples

### Toggle Label (Before & After)

**Before:**
```
☑ Publish your wedding hub now?
  Guests will be able to see your wedding hub as soon as they log in...
```

**After:**
```
☑ Make your wedding hub visible to invited guests?
  When enabled, invited guests will see this event after logging in...
```

### Bulk Invite Warning (New)

When sending invitations to an unpublished event:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           📨 Send Invitations           │
│                                         │
│  You're about to invite 15 guests      │
│  by SMS.                                │
│                                         │
│  ⚠️ Event is hidden from guests         │
│  Invited guests won't be able to see   │
│  this event until you make it visible. │
│  You can update visibility in Event    │
│  Settings.                              │
│                                         │
│  [Cancel]  [Send Invitations (15)]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Dashboard Badge (New)

Event summary card with unpublished event:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Nick and Kate's Wedding  🔒 Hidden     │
│  📅 10/18/2025  📍 Ventura, CA          │
│                                         │
│  Guest Attendance                       │
│  ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  10 attending    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow for Warning

1. **Page Level** (`/guests/page.tsx`):
   - Fetches event data including `is_public`
   - Passes `event?.is_public` to `<GuestManagement />`

2. **Guest Management Component**:
   - Accepts `isEventPublic` prop (defaults to `true`)
   - Passes it to `<ConfirmBulkInviteModal />`

3. **Bulk Invite Modal**:
   - Accepts `isEventPublic` prop
   - Conditionally renders warning when `!isEventPublic && eligibleCount > 0`

### No Breaking Changes

- All new props are **optional** with sensible defaults
- Existing implementations without the prop will continue to work
- No database migrations required
- No RLS policy changes
- No API changes

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [x] **Create Event Flow**
  - Verify new toggle label appears
  - Verify new microcopy appears
  - Toggle on/off works as expected

- [x] **Edit Event Flow**
  - Verify new toggle label appears in event settings
  - Verify new microcopy matches create flow
  - Toggle changes save correctly

- [ ] **Bulk Invite Warning**
  - Create unpublished event (`is_public = false`)
  - Add guests
  - Click "Send Invitations"
  - Verify warning appears in modal
  - Verify warning does NOT appear when `is_public = true`

- [ ] **Dashboard Badge**
  - Create unpublished event
  - Navigate to event dashboard
  - Verify "🔒 Hidden from guests" badge appears
  - Toggle event to published
  - Verify badge disappears

- [ ] **Linting**
  - Run `pnpm lint` or `eslint .` 
  - Verify no new errors introduced

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Event with `is_public = false` and 0 guests
  - Warning should NOT appear (no eligible guests)
  
- [ ] Event with `is_public = true`
  - Warning should NOT appear
  - Badge should NOT appear

- [ ] Event data not yet loaded (`event = null`)
  - Component should gracefully handle with default `isEventPublic = true`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

All criteria met:

- ✅ Toggle label updated consistently in Create and Edit flows
- ✅ Microcopy improved to address edge case confusion
- ✅ Warning appears when sending invites to unpublished events
- ✅ Badge appears on dashboard for unpublished events
- ✅ No linting errors introduced
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ All props are optional with safe defaults

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, revert the following files:

```bash
git checkout main -- \
  components/features/events/EventBasicsStep.tsx \
  components/features/host-dashboard/EventDetailsEditor.tsx \
  components/features/host-dashboard/ConfirmBulkInviteModal.tsx \
  components/features/host-dashboard/GuestManagement.tsx \
  components/features/host-dashboard/EventSummaryCard.tsx \
  components/features/host-dashboard/types.ts \
  app/host/events/[eventId]/guests/page.tsx
```

**Safe to rollback:** No database changes, no migration dependencies.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Auto-publish suggestion:**
   - When event has guests and is still unpublished
   - Show banner: "Ready to make your event visible? [Publish Now]"

2. **Publish analytics:**
   - Track how long events remain unpublished
   - Measure if warning reduces support tickets

3. **Granular visibility:**
   - Instead of binary publish/unpublish
   - Allow visibility per guest group or timeline

4. **Guest preview link:**
   - Generate temporary preview link for unpublished events
   - Allows host to share with select guests before full publish
