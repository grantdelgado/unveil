// Route-based code splitting
const HostRoutes = lazy(() => import('@/app/host/layout'));
const GuestRoutes = lazy(() => import('@/app/guest/layout'));
```

**Phase 2: Provider Optimization (Week 3-4)**
- Move Supabase client (122KB) to route-level instantiation
- Implement provider lazy loading with suspense boundaries
- Optimize React Query configuration for smaller initial bundle

**Affected Surfaces:**
- All route layouts (`app/host/*`, `app/guest/*`)
- Provider stack (`lib/providers/*`)
- Bundle configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- 5 routes currently >300KB First Load JS

### Impact Analysis

**User Impact (40% weight = 38/40 points):**
