jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Report Freshness
        run: |
          LATEST_REPORT=$(find docs/reports -name "state_of_*" -mtime -30)
          if [ -z "$LATEST_REPORT" ]; then
            echo "❌ Health reports older than 30 days - time for refresh!"
            exit 1
          fi
```
