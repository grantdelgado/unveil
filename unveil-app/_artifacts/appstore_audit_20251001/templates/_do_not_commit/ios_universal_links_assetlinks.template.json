<!-- 
DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Replace TEAMID with your actual Apple Developer Team ID
   - Find in Apple Developer Portal > Membership
   - Format: 10-character alphanumeric string (e.g., "ABCD123456")

2. Host this file at: https://app.sendunveil.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
   - No file extension required
   - Must be served over HTTPS
   - Content-Type: application/json
   - Must be accessible without authentication

3. Vercel deployment (add to vercel.json):
   {
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/.well-known/apple-app-site-association",
         "dest": "/apple-app-site-association.json",
         "headers": {
           "Content-Type": "application/json"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

4. Next.js deployment (add to next.config.js):
   async rewrites() {
     return [
       {
         source: '/.well-known/apple-app-site-association',
         destination: '/api/apple-app-site-association'
       }
     ];
   }

5. Validation:
   - Test URL accessibility: curl https://app.sendunveil.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
   - Validate JSON format: Use online JSON validators
   - Test Universal Links: Use iOS Simulator or device

6. Path Pattern Explanations:
   - "*" matches any single path segment
   - "/*" matches any path including subdirectories
   - Paths are case-sensitive
   - Order matters for overlapping patterns

7. Testing Universal Links:
   - iOS Simulator: xcrun simctl openurl booted "https://app.sendunveil.com/select-event"
   - Device: Send link via Messages or Mail, tap to test
   - Verify app opens instead of Safari

8. Troubleshooting:
   - Ensure file is accessible without redirects
   - Check HTTPS certificate validity
   - Verify Team ID matches Apple Developer account
   - Confirm bundle identifier matches app configuration
   - Test with different iOS versions

9. Security Considerations:
   - File should be publicly accessible
   - No sensitive information in paths or comments
   - Regular validation of file accessibility
   - Monitor for unauthorized modifications

10. Maintenance:
    - Update paths when adding new routes
    - Test after domain or hosting changes
    - Validate after iOS app updates
    - Keep Team ID current if changed
