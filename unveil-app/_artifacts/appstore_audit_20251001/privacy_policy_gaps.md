# Privacy Policy Gap Analysis - iOS App Store Compliance
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Project:** Unveil Wedding App  
**Purpose:** Identify privacy policy updates needed for iOS App Store submission  

## Current Privacy Policy Assessment

### Policy Location Analysis
**Current Web Policy:** Based on codebase references, privacy policy likely exists at:
- Primary: `https://sendunveil.com/privacy`
- App Reference: Check `app/layout.tsx` and marketing site integration

**App Store Requirements:**
- Privacy policy URL must be provided during App Store submission
- Policy must be accessible without requiring app download
- Policy must be current and specifically address mobile app data practices

## Apple-Specific Requirements vs Current Coverage

### ✅ **Likely Already Covered (Based on Audit)**

| Requirement | Evidence | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Data Collection Disclosure** | Comprehensive data matrix documented | ✅ Covered |
| **Third-Party Sharing** | Twilio, Sentry usage documented | ✅ Covered |
| **Security Measures** | RLS, encryption documented | ✅ Covered |
| **User Rights** | GDPR compliance implemented | ✅ Covered |

### ⚠️ **Gaps Requiring iOS-Specific Updates**

#### 1. Mobile App Context
**Gap:** Policy may be web-focused, needs mobile app specificity

**Required Updates:**
```
- Add section: "Mobile App Data Collection"
- Specify iOS app data practices vs web app
- Address native app permissions (camera, notifications)
- Clarify offline data storage on device
```

#### 2. App Store Privacy Labels
**Gap:** Policy must align with App Store privacy nutrition labels

**Required Updates:**
```
- Add section mapping to iOS privacy categories:
  * Contact Info (phone, email, name)
  * User Content (photos, videos, messages)  
  * Identifiers (user IDs)
  * Usage Data (app interactions)
  * Diagnostics (performance, error data)
```

#### 3. Device-Specific Data Collection
**Gap:** iOS-specific data collection practices

**Required Updates:**
```
- Device Information Collection:
  * iOS version for compatibility
  * Device model for optimization
  * Push notification tokens (if implemented)
  * App version for support purposes

- Local Storage Practices:
  * Cached data on device
  * Offline functionality data
  * Session storage in native app
```

#### 4. Third-Party SDK Disclosures
**Gap:** Native app may use additional SDKs

**Required Updates:**
```
- Capacitor Framework:
  * Native bridge functionality
  * Device capability access
  * Local data storage

- iOS System Integration:
  * Photo library access (if implemented)
  * Camera access (if implemented)  
  * Push notifications (if implemented)
```

#### 5. Age Rating Compliance
**Gap:** Policy must support chosen age rating

**Required Updates:**
```
- Age Rating Justification (12+ or 17+):
  * User-generated content policies
  * Social interaction guidelines
  * Content moderation practices
  * Parental guidance recommendations
```

### ❌ **Critical Missing Sections for iOS**

#### 1. App Store Specific Disclosures
**Missing:** Apple-required privacy disclosures

**Required Additions:**
```markdown
## iOS App Privacy

### Data Linked to You
We collect the following data that is linked to your identity:
- Contact information (phone number, optional email, name)
- User content (photos, videos, messages)

- Usage data (feature interactions for app improvement)
- Sensitive information (SMS consent records for legal compliance)

### Data Not Linked to You  
We collect the following data that is not linked to your identity:
- Diagnostics (error reports, performance metrics)
- All diagnostic data is anonymized and contains no personal identifiers

### No Tracking
This app does not track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

#### 2. Native App Permissions
**Missing:** iOS permission usage justification

**Required Additions:**
```markdown
## iOS App Permissions

### Camera Access (Future Feature)
- Purpose: Photo and video capture for event sharing

```

#### 3. Offline Data Handling
**Missing:** Native app offline capabilities

**Required Additions:**
```markdown
## Offline Data Storage

### Local Device Storage
- Purpose: App functionality when internet unavailable
- Data Types: Cached event data, user preferences, draft messages
- Security: Local data encrypted using iOS security features
- Retention: Cleared when app deleted or cache manually cleared

### Data Synchronization
- Purpose: Sync local changes when internet restored
- Process: Secure upload of offline changes to servers
- Conflict Resolution: User notified of any data conflicts
```

#### 4. Data Retention for Mobile
**Missing:** Mobile-specific retention policies

**Required Additions:**
```markdown
## Mobile App Data Retention

### Account Data
- Retention: Until account deletion requested
- Deletion Process: Contact support@sendunveil.com
- Timeline: Account data deleted within 30 days of request

### Local Device Data
- Automatic Cleanup: App cache cleared periodically
- Manual Cleanup: User can clear cache in app settings
- App Deletion: All local data removed when app deleted

### Backup Considerations
- iOS Backup: App data may be included in device backups
- User Control: Can exclude app from backups in iOS Settings
- Security: Backup data encrypted if device backup encrypted
```
