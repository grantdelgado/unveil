## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions Made:
- **2024-01-XX**: Chose warm coral `#FF6B6B` as primary action color
- **2024-01-XX**: Standardized on `max-w-sm` for mobile-first cards
- **2024-01-XX**: Implemented fade-in-up animation for page entrances
- **Phase F**: Replaced all stone-* colors with gray-* for consistency
- **Phase F**: Migrated manual card styling to CardContainer component

### Technical Notes:
- Custom animation added to `app/globals.css`
- Design system documented in `docs/unveil-design-system.md`
- Style guide updated in `reference/style-guide.md`
- Component library provides reusable UI patterns
- All builds passing with 29/29 tests successful

### Future Considerations:
- Consider expanding card max-width for desktop content pages
- Component library ready for new feature development
- Design system established for consistent future additions

## 🚨 Critical Guidelines

### ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY:
- Any authentication logic or Supabase calls
- Business logic, form handling, or data processing
- Routing or navigation behavior
- Backend API calls or database operations

### ✅ SAFE TO MODIFY:
- Tailwind CSS classes and styling
- HTML structure for layout improvements
- Component composition and organization
- Animation and transition effects
- Development mode presentation
