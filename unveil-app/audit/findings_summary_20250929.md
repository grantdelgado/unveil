**Effort**: 1 day  
**Files**: `hooks/messaging/useGuestMessagesRPC.ts`

#### 3. No Server-Side Schedule Rendering
**Issue**: Guest schedule page fully client-rendered, missing SSR benefits  
**Impact**: Slower initial load, reduced SEO, worse mobile performance  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Files**: `app/guest/events/[eventId]/schedule/page.tsx`

### üîß Development Experience Gaps

#### 4. Missing CI Bundle Monitoring
**Issue**: No automated bundle size regression detection  
**Impact**: Performance regressions can slip into production  
**Effort**: 4 hours  
**Files**: CI/CD configuration, GitHub Actions

#### 5. Limited Authenticated Testing  
**Issue**: Playwright tests don't cover authenticated mobile UX flows  
**Impact**: Mobile interaction bugs may reach production  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Files**: `playwright-tests/`, test infrastructure

#### 6. No External Metrics Visibility
**Issue**: Realtime connection health not visible to DevOps monitoring  
**Impact**: Cannot proactively detect connectivity issues  
**Effort**: 1 day  
**Files**: `lib/realtime/SubscriptionManager.ts`

### üé® UX Polish Gaps

#### 7. Basic Auth Progress Indicators
**Issue**: Magic link flow lacks step-by-step progress indication  
**Impact**: Users may think system is unresponsive  
**Effort**: 4 hours  
**Files**: Auth components, progress indicators

#### 8. Login Page LCP Not Measured
**Issue**: Lighthouse cannot detect LCP on login page  
**Impact**: Performance monitoring blind spot  
**Effort**: 1 hour  
**Files**: `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

### üìä Data & Monitoring Gaps

#### 9. RLS Settings Undocumented
**Issue**: Some tables may have `force_rls = false` without documentation  
**Impact**: Potential security policy inconsistencies  
**Effort**: 4 hours  
**Files**: Database documentation

#### 10. Query Performance Monitoring Missing
**Issue**: No automated slow query detection or index usage analysis  
**Impact**: Performance degradation may go unnoticed  
**Effort**: 1 day  
**Files**: Database monitoring setup

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Excluded)

### ‚ùå Out of Scope
1. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Project explicitly disables dark mode
2. **Backend Architecture Changes**: Core messaging/auth system is stable
3. **Database Schema Changes**: Schema is well-optimized, only index tuning needed
4. **Major Bundle Restructuring**: Current dynamic import strategy is sound
5. **Mobile App Development**: Focus remains on PWA/mobile web experience

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred (Not Current Priorities)
1. **Advanced A/B Testing**: Not mentioned in opportunities, complex implementation
2. **Offline-First Capabilities**: PWA works offline, but complex state sync not prioritized
